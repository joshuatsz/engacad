                        <p>Hello, Hi there, as you can see that's me on the left! Just an ordinary girl that loves going on adventures to lazing around with tidbits on hand while watching Netflix...shhh
                        <p> Now that I have exposed how I look like, let me tell you more about myself.</p>
                        <p>I am Mei Fang from the school of DEEE(Diploma in Electrical and Electronic Engineering) in Singapore Polytechnic(SP).
                        <br />Yes, we all know this stereotype that Engineering girls are the minority here, this is true speaking from a 2:19 ratio in my class... but still, I hold such brain power to do awesome things here! :-) </p>
                        </div>
                      </div>
                    <div id="footer">
                      <hr />
                              <h2>My life, My hobbies</h2>
                              <p>One interesting fact is that I'm the youngest child out of 6 siblings! People tend to express shock when I tell them this, I guess the more the merrier... right? Even so, the amount of knowledge passed down is overwhelming! I have fellow engineers in my household, Including my father! Throughout all these years it's always interesting to watch how my father fixed the broken lighting, connect cables around house, building up furnitures and so much more. I am sometimes his right-arm man! I guess that's where my interest in engineering came along, because I've always been exposed to it.</p>
                              <p>I am also a person of many interest, I tend to explore more on things to do than to just stay on one hobby, but there's one activity I adore, which is hiking! It is one of my all time favorite outdoor activity to do. I've been to Bukit Batok Nature Park,Fort canning Park and many more. It is always nice to be out in the nature once in awhile away from the hassle and bustle of modern structures. The view and sceneries are a bonus on such journeys, and I urge all of you to start taking time to look at the relaxing sky from time to time, it really is magical.
                              <p>Oh, you may be wondering, "Why is she here? Why is she in EA?" Well, to put in simple description, I'm here because i thrive to achieve more than just what i learn in DEEE,
                                 I thrive to expand my knowledge on Engineering through Hands-on projects, teamwork and work-like tasks. I am confident that in EA, all that I've learn before will further broaden my horizons.
                                 I agree that i might not be the best here in Engineering Academy, I may not have the best GPA or the smartest brain,
                                 but I will do my best to complete tasks that will be given to me, and push through all difficulties faced in this journey of discovering.
                                 Who knows? i may find out more about myself along the way.
                              </p>
